## Publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities

Over the years, I have responsibly reported security vulnerabilities; some have been made public.

- **Untrusted search path on Windows systems leading to arbitrary code execution  in GitPython: [GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on Windows systems
  by tricking the user into running GitPython from an untrusted directory or repository.

- **Blind local file inclusion in GitPython: [GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to make GitPython read arbitrary files from the filesystem,
  this can be used to check if a file exists or not, or cause a denial of service by reading a large file.

- **Arbitrary write to files from builder server in Read the Docs: [GHSA-v7x4-rhpg-3p2r](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-v7x4-rhpg-3p2r) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to write to any files that the application has write access to.
  The contents that can be written aren't fully controlled by the attacker, so the impact of this attack is limited.

- **Write access to projects via API V2 for any logged-in user in Read the Docs: [GHSA-rqfv-8rrx-prmh](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-rqfv-8rrx-prmh) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to use the API v2 to create, update, and delete any projects on the community version of Read the Docs.
  On Read the Docs for Business the malicious user needs to belong to the organization of the target project in order to exploit this vulnerability
  (to any team of the organization with at least read only access).

- **CAS session hijacking in Read the Docs for Businesses: [GHSA-4mgr-vrh5-hj8q](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-4mgr-vrh5-hj8q) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to hijack a specific type of user session, given a crafted URL.
  Exploiting this vulnerability would have required the user to follow a malicious link,
  allowing the attacker to steal the CAS ticket used to authenticate the user towards several read-only APIs.

- **Serving content from pull requests previews on main docs domains in Read the Docs: [GHSA-h4cf-8gv8-4chf](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-h4cf-8gv8-4chf) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary content under the main domain of documentation sites.

- **Cache poisoning: serving arbitrary content on documentation sites in Read the Docs [GHSA-mp38-vprc-7hf5](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-mp38-vprc-7hf5) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary content on documentation sites they don't own.

- **Arbitrary code execution when using treesitter with injections in Neovim: [GHSA-6f9m-hj8h-xjgj](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/security/advisories/GHSA-6f9m-hj8h-xjgj) (2023)**

- **Path traversal: access to files from any project in Read the Docs: [GHSA-5w8m-r7jm-mhp9](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-5w8m-r7jm-mhp9) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to access documentation files from any project given its slug, regardless of user permissions.
  This was possible using a crafted URL that can bypass the path traversal protections.

- **Symlink following: arbitrary file access from builder server in Read the Docs: [GHSA-hqwg-gjqw-h5wg](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-hqwg-gjqw-h5wg) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to access any files that the application has read access to.
  Exploiting this vulnerability requires creating symlinks that pointed to files outside a project root.

- **Cache poisoning in Read the Docs: [GHSA-7fcx-wwr3-99jv](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-7fcx-wwr3-99jv) (2023)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to get some private information about a user account like: username, name, and audit logs.

- **Arbitrary command execution in simple-git: [CVE-2022-25860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25860) (2022)**

- **Symlink following: arbitrary file access from builder server in Read the Docs: [GHSA-368m-86q9-m99w](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-368m-86q9-m99w) (2022)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to access any files that the application has read access to.
  Exploiting this vulnerability requires creating symlinks that pointed to files outside a project root.

- **Allow serving of arbitrary HTML files from the main domain in Read the Docs: [GHSA-98pf-gfh3-x3mp](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-98pf-gfh3-x3mp) (2022)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary HTML files from the main application domain (readthedocs.org/readthedocs.com).

- **CSRF from documentation domains in Read the Docs: [GHSA-3v5m-qmm9-3c6c](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-3v5m-qmm9-3c6c) (2021)**

  This could have allowed a malicious user to fetch internal and private information from a logged user in readthedocs.org/readthedocs.com
  by creating a malicious site hosted on readthedocs.io/readthedocs-hosted.com or from any custom domain registered in the platform.

- **Serving arbitrary files in domains of other projects in Read the Docs: <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html#release-2-3-0> (2018)**

  This vulnerability could have allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary files in other projects domains by adding a project as translation of the target project.
